# Financial Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the final implementation for the GRAD 50400 team project on financial fraud detection.

## Overview
The project explores multiple supervised machine learning models to detect fraudulent financial transactions using the PaySim synthetic dataset. Models evaluated include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and a PyTorch-based Multilayer Perceptron.

## Repository Contents
- `fraud_detection.ipynb`: Final notebook containing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the notebook.

## Running the Notebook
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
2. Open and run fraud_detection.ipynb

## Notes

Datasets are not included in this repository due to size and licensing constraints. Please download the PaySim dataset from Kaggle and place it in the expected directory before running the notebook.
